Hypertension remains the dominant application area, driven by the rising prevalence of treatment-resistant hypertension and the need for effective blood pressure management solutions. Renal denervation therapy systems offer a promising approach to reduce hypertension by disrupting renal nerves, thereby potentially lowering blood pressure in patients who do not respond well to traditional therapies.Diabetes is another significant application segment, where renal denervation therapy is explored for its potential to improve glucose metabolism and renal function in diabetic patients. The therapy aims to mitigate diabetic nephropathy and other complications associated with diabetes, contributing to better patient outcomes. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents another critical area, addressing the renal component of CKD by potentially slowing disease progression and preserving kidney function. This application segment underscores the importance of renal denervation in managing the renal aspects of chronic conditions.Heart failure is also emerging as an application area, focusing on the role of renal denervation in improving cardiovascular outcomes by addressing the interaction between the kidneys and heart. Other applications include exploring renal denervation therapy for conditions beyond the primary indications, reflecting ongoing research into its broader therapeutic potential.
